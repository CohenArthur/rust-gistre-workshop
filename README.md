# rust-gistre-workshop

The objective of this workshop is to offer an exploration of the
[Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org), and more precisely its application
in the embedded world.
This workshop is aimed at EPITA students, and especially those of the GISTRE major.

# Exercise correction

Exercises are available for each lesson. You are not required to do them, considering that
attendance to the workshop is not mandatory. However, we would be delighted to review your
code and give you various tips!

In order to do so, please abide by the following guidelines:

- Fork this repository
  - It is *necessary* for the fork to be open-source! If not, we will *not* be able to review
your code.

- Create a branch on your repository
  - `git checkout -b exercises_intro`
  - The name does not matter at all. But you must create a different branch for us to see
only the changes you wish to show us.

- Work on your branch, completing exercises

- Open a pull-request on *your own repository* (`https://github.com/<your_username>/rust-gistre-workshop`)
  - You can ping us in the comments, ask us on Discord or send us an email. Pinging on Github
works the same as in Discord, `@<username>` will notify the user. Checkout [the team](#the-team)
for our Github usernames! We will review the code as well as give you tips if you need them.

# Update your fork

To update your fork, you could run the following commands:
```sh
$ [[ $(git remote | grep upstream) ]] \
  || git remote add upstream https://github.com/CohenArthur/rust-gistre-workshop.git
$ git fetch upstream
$ git checkout master
$ git rebase upstream/master
```

# Misc

A *lot* of resources are available to learn Rust online!

* [rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings)
* [The Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
* [Exercism](https://exercism.io/tracks/rust)
* [awesome-rust](https://github.com/rust-unofficial/awesome-rust)

We won't have done them all, but there's a good chance we'll be able to help you understand
them, complete them or review them. Feel free to ping us for those as well!

# Going further

If you now love Rust and wish for more, contact us for project ideas or good first issues
